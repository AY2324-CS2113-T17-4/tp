## Overview

NUSDegs streamlines the process of degree planning for NUS computing students by offering personalized module
schedules, progress tracking, and ensuring on-time graduation. It eliminates guesswork, reduces stress, and saves time
for students. This is a comprehensive tool for efficient and successful degree completion.


### Summary of Contributions

#### Features Implemented

#### 1. Search 

Feature: Allows user to search the NUSModsAPI database by keywords of the module title 

Justification: While planning their schedule, users can search for modules they would like to add based on keywords of 
the module title.

#### 2. Info description

Feature: Allows user to get description of a module using modulecode

Justification: If user would like a better description of a module they find using the 'search' function, 
or any module in general

#### 3. Timetable Feature Integration

Feature: Displays the weekly timetable of the user.     

What it does: Using the lessons added by the user through Timetable Modify Feature, this feature displays the user's
lessons sorted by time and day.

Justification: This feature gives users a clear idea on how their current semester will look like on a weekly basis.
This will enable them to view their timetable easily.

Highlights: Lessons are displayed by time and day and does not show days that do not have lessons.

Credits: I have implemented the integration of the timetable feature into the main program by 
developing dedicated functions. These functions serve as the bridge between the existing codebase and the timetable.
